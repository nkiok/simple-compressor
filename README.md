# simple-compressor

You are working on a system that works with bitmap images, and are running out of disc space. Write functions to compress and decompress a bitmap.

If your SDK has zip or something similar, pretend it doesn't.
For simplicity the input bitmap is a string, and that you know any metadata (width, colour depth) that you think you might need.
